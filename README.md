# lululemon-scrape
This is a project to gather product information and reviews of mens pant's on Lululemon's website in order to better understand which products I should purchase in the future.

I will be using the BeautifulSoup package in Python in order to collect all the information.

I'm seeing how I can save and push to GitHub
